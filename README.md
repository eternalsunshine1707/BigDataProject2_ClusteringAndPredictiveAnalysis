# <u> CSCI 6444: INTRODUCTION TO BIG DATA &amp; ANALYTICS </u>
# Project 1: EXPLORING VARIATIONS IN CLUSTERING AND PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS 
<p align="center"><u><b>Project Description</b></u></p>
The dataset contains a mix of raw and synthetic data related to obesity and health factors. It has
2112 instances (observations) and 17 attributes (features). The attributes include a mix of
categorical and numeric variables related to an individual's demographic information, lifestyle,
eating habits, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI) category. The project aims to predict which features are the most useful in predicting obesity. 

This project has provided a comprehensive learning experience in several key aspects of data
science, particularly in data exploration, clustering, and predictive analysis. Here's a breakdown of
the insights I gained through each phase of the project:<br>

<b>Data Exploration:</b>
- By conducting pairwise plotting and exploring the correlations between attributes, I gained
a deeper understanding of the relationships within the dataset.
- Visualizations such as scatter plots and correlation matrices helped to identify potential
patterns and dependencies between variables.
- Investigating statistics of the dataset through summary() and describe() functions provided
insights into the distribution and summary statistics of the data.<br>

<b>Data Preparation:</b>
- The process of subsetting the data and selecting the most relevant attributes involved
critical decision-making based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge.
- Translating alphanumeric values into numeric values required thoughtful mapping
strategies to ensure accurate representation of categorical variables.<br>

<b>Clustering:</b>
- Applying clustering algorithms to the dataset allowed for the identification of natural
groupings or clusters within the data.
- Utilizing methods like k-means clustering and visualizing the clusters using tools like
factoextra:fviz_cluster() facilitated the interpretation and understanding of the data
structure.<br>

<b>Prediction:</b>
- Implementing predictive models using techniques such as Generalized Linear Models
(GLM) provided insights into the predictive power of the selected features.
- Evaluating model performance through measures like accuracy, false positives, etc., offered
a quantitative assessment of the predictive capabilities of the models.

This project has demonstrated the iterative and interdisciplinary nature of data science. It required a
combination of statistical knowledge, programming skills, and domain expertise to effectively
explore, analyze, and derive insights from the dataset. It also highlighted the importance of data
preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation in the predictive modeling process. Through
hands-on experience with real-world data, weâ€™ve gained valuable insights into the practical
application of data science techniques and their implications for decision-making and problemsolving in various domains.
